# Identifying shopping centers with high operating loss risk and potential redevelopment opportunities

Chi Zhang, Candiadte MUSA 2022
## Background
According to the data from Yingshang.com, the number of shopping centers opened or to be opened in Shanghai will be as high as 418. For 2020, The area of shopping centers per person(ASCPP) is 0.97, meanwhile the number of America is 2.15. Based on the demand model of shopping centers, the demand area is influenced by the residential consumption capabilities. Therefore, in fact, the supply area of shopping centers in Shanghai is almost 3 times of the supply in the United States. Instead of constructing new shopping centers to stimulate the market, it is more important to focus on the stock market and avoid overbuilding.
## Goals
This research aims to use econometric model to validate if shopping center overbuilt exists in Shanghai. For the over-developed districts, a regression model is built to identify surplus shopping centers with investment potential for future regeneration or redevelopment.
